# NotionAI.js

NotionAI.js is a JavaScript library that provides a simple and convenient interface for interacting with the Notion API. It includes functions for writing prompts, changing the tone of text, translating text, and more.

## Installation (not ready yet) 

You can start by cloning or forking the project from GitHub.

To install NotionAI.js, you can use npm:

```
npm install notionai
```

## usage ï¼š

```
// setting and import
import { NotionAI } from './src/NotionAI.js';
import { TOPICS, TONE, LANGUAGE } from './src/types.js';
const notionAI = new NotionAI(process.env["TOKEN"], process.env["SPACE_ID"]);

// usage example
let pageTitle = "Scrum member summary"
let pageContent = "This document will introduce you to the members of a Scrum team, including the Scrum Master, the Product Owner, and the development team members"
let selectedText = ""
await notionAI.writingPrompt(prompt, pageTitle, selectedText, pageContent).then((text) => {
    result = text;
    console.log(`Writing with topic "${topic}": ${result}`);
}).catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
});
```

Make sure to replace process.env["TOKEN"] and process.env["SPACE_ID"] with your actual Notion API token and space ID, respectively.

The NotionAI class relies on the setting class for its configuration options, which include the Notion API token and space ID.

To use the NotionAI class, you can import it and create a new instance with the Notion API token and space ID. Then, you can call any of its methods with the appropriate parameters to make a request to the Notion API.

## How to get the token and spaceId

Make sure you subscribe to NotionAI; otherwise, you will only be able to use it 20 times.

You can refer to https://github.com/HCYT/notionAI/issues/1 to learn how to get the token and spaceId.
